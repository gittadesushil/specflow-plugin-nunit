# SpecFlow NUnit3 Plugin

This plugin modifies the behavior of the default NUnit3 test generator (NUnit3TestGeneratorProvider) by adding the `global` keyword to the fully qualified attribute types that it outputs.

For example:

```C#
[NUnit.Framework.TestFixtureAttribute()]
```
becomes

```
[global::NUnit.Framework.TestFixtureAttribute()]
```

**Why would I want to do this?**

If a test project has a default namespace with "NUnit" in the name, then the test code generated by SpecFlow will not compile.

> The type or namespace name 'Framework' does not exist in the namespace 'Test.NUnit' (are you missing an assembly reference?)
>
> Cannot resolve symbol 'Framework'

You could resolve this issue by updating the default namespace in the test project to remove NUnit. This is the best option, but it is not always possible. You may have CI scripts that look for NUnit in the namespaces. In this instance, the **NUnit3WithGlobalTestGenerator** plugin is useful.
